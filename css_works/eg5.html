            <li>Coffee is consumed in such great quantities, it is the world’s 2nd largest traded commodity, surpassed
                only by crude oil. It is our most beloved beverage after water. It’s worth well over $100 billion
                worldwide.</li>
            <li>Arabica coffee was originally cultivated on the Arabian Peninsula, hence the name. Robusta coffee is a
                more hardy plant but contains double the amount of caffeine.</li>
            <li>According to International Coffee Association, Europe imports more coffee than the USA. Also, Brazil is
                the lead exporting country in coffee.</li>
            <li>The “Big Four” coffee roasting companies – Kraft, P&G, Sara Lee and Nestle – buy about 50% of the coffee
                produced worldwide.</li>
            <li>Coffee beans grow on a bush. They are actually the pit of a berry, which makes them a fruit. There are
                two main varieties of beans: green and red. Red beans have a nicer smell and are less acidic. </li>
                <li>
                    Brazil couldn’t afford to send its athletes to Los Angeles for the 1932 Olympics, so the government sent them in a ship full of coffee which was sold on the way to finance their trip.
